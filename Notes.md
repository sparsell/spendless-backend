# User Stories...A user should be able to:
    []  Set a goal to "not spend" an aspirational amount
    []  Add an amount they mindfully did not spend on something or somewhere, although they were tempted or were on auto-pilot
    []  As they add amounts they did not spend, they can see the total "not spent" go up and progress to meet the goal
    []  When they reach the goal, they are rewarded with a message
# What does your appÂ *do*?
        - SpendLess is a way to be more mindful of how you spend your money and gently shows you it's easier to reach a goal than you think when you really focus on it.
