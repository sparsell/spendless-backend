 Spendless runs on Ruby on Rails (as an API) and JavaScript. It uses a Postgres Database. 

 Once you clone the git respository, you need to create the database and run the migrations.

Spendless is a tool to help you be more mindful of how you spend your money. We make a lot of purchases on automatic. Spendless will keep track the amounts of money you save on purchases that you paused to consider. 

You can log things like:

- you waited to buy something on sale
- you bought an item in bulk so it was cheaper
- you made dinner at home instead of going out
- you found a generic brand
- you bought at a second hand store or through on an online marketplace

How to use Spendless:

    The first time you open the app, you will see there is no goal set. Enter a goal amount in the space provided. 

    Now, start logging the times when you spent less (than you could or would have). Each amount will be added to the total. You can also add a description. 
    
    When you reach your goal, you can celebrate!
